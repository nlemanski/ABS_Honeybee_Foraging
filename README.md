# ABS_Honeybee_Foraging
Agent Based Simulation of Collective Foraging in Honeybees

To examine how the spatial distribution of resources interacts with individual behavior to shape collective foraging decisions, we expanded on a previous model called ABBAS (Animal Behavior Based on Agents Simulations). The present model simulates food patches with three different qualities, in two alternative distributions: clumped and dispersed. This model allows us to examine how forager persistence and the behavioral composition of the colony (number of scouts) interact with landscape structure to influence the colony's collective choice of which resource patches to exploit.
