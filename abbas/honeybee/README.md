The code to run one iteration of the ABBAS simulation is contained in the script files 'Agent_diversity.py' and 'Forage_diversity.py.' The script 'Agent_diversity.py' encodes the behavior of each type of forager in a colony. The script 'Forage_diversity.py' encodes one instance of the model, including the behavioral composition of the colony and the spatial structure of the resource landscape.
